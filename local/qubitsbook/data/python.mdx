# Loops in Python

Most of the actions in this world occur repeatedly. For example, if you have to walk one kilometer to reach a mall, you put your left and right foot forward, alternatively, to cover the distance. You repeatedly put each of your feet forward, one by one, a number of times until you reach the mall. Similarly in programming, you need to repeat a set of code multiple times more often than not. Loops help us to reduce this process of repetition.

In Python, the for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list or string and other iterable objects such as a range.

Using a `for` loop, we can iterate over each item in the sequence and execute the same set of commands for each item. This way we can automate and repeat tasks in an efficient manner.

Print the `Hello` statement five times by repeating the statements.

```python
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
```

Write a program to get the same output using a `for` loop.

```python,editable,python-1
for i in range(5):
       print("Hello")
```

Here `range(5)` returns a list of numbers from 0 to 4, that is, five elements. Therefore it repeats five times. So the `for` loop executes the `print("Hello")` statement five times.

# Prime Number

A natural number greater than 1 that can only be divided by 1 or the number itself is a prime number. Given below is a list of the first few prime numbers, in an increasing order:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23,...

Letâ€™s write a program to check if a number is prime or not.

```python,editable,python-2,input
num = int(input("Enter a number:"))
prime = True

if num <= 1:
   prime=False

for i in range(2,num):
       if (num % i) == 0:
           prime = False
           break
if prime:
      print(num,"is a prime number")
else:
      print(num,"is not a prime number")
```

# File I/O

Now let's learn how to read and write to a file

```python,
def fun():
    file = open("tes.txt","w")
    L = ["This is Test File"]
    file.writelines(L)
    file = open("tes.txt","r+")
    return(file.read())
fun()
```
