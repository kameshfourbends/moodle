# SQL Basics

### Create the table

To create a table in SQL, you can use the following syntax:

> CREATE TABLE table_name (
> column_name1 data_type constraint,
> column_name2 data_type constraint,
> ...
> );

For example, to create a table called "students" with columns for "id", "name", and "age", you would use the following SQL statement:

```sql,editable,sql-1
CREATE TABLE students (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, age INT);
```

### Insert data

To insert data into the table, you can use the following syntax:

> INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
> VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

For example, to insert a student with an id of 1, a name of "John Smith", and an age of 20 into the "students" table, you would use the following SQL statement:

```sql,editable,sql-2
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John Smith', 12);
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age) VALUES (2, 'Fahed Khan', 13);
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age) VALUES (3, 'Maryiam Sulfi', 13);
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age) VALUES (4, 'De Paul Mathew', 12);
```

### Select and display the data

To display the data in the table, you can use the SELECT statement.

> SELECT \* FROM table_name;

For example, to display all the data in the "students" table, you would use the following SQL statement:

```sql,editable,sql-3
SELECT * FROM students;
```

### Filter Data

To select a specific student with a specific ID from a table in SQL, you can use the following syntax:

> SELECT \* FROM table_name WHERE column_name = value;

For example, to select the student with an ID of 1 from the "students" table, you would use the following SQL statement:

```sql,editable,sql-4
SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = 1;
```

### Use a pre-defined table to load data from.. The table will be served from the webserver...

```sql
--DATA:users
select * from users;
```
